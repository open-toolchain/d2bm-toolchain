  Ａｆｔｅｒ ｙｏｕ ｃｌｉｃｋ **Deploy**, your app will be deployed to Bluemix.ฏูİı｜]
  Your app's code will be automatically loaded into a Git repo. Each time you commit
  changes to the repo, they are automatically deployed by using a toolchain that is
  associated with your app. You can add more tools to the toolchain and share it with
  your team. [Learn more](https:[G'//ｂｌｕｅｍｉｘ.ｎｅｔ/ｄevops/getting-started).ฏูİı｜]
  The toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.
  If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Deploy**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and
  terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https:[G'//ｃｏｎｓｏｌｅ.ｎｇ.ｂｌｕｅmix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).ฏูİı｜]
  Still need to create a project at JazzHub? You can still
  [create a project](https:[G'//ｈｕｂ.ｊａｚｚ.ｎｅｔ/ｄeploy?legacy&repository={[{repository}]}),ฏูİı｜]
  but if you do, you must upgrade that project to a toolchain soon.
