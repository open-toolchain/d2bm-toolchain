template.description: |
  After you click **Deploy**, your app will be deployed to Bluemix.~otc-ui571
  Your app's code will be automatically loaded into a Git repo. Each time you commit
  changes to the repo, they are automatically deployed by using a toolchain that is
  associated with your app. You can add more tools to the toolchain and share it with
  your team. [Learn more](https://bluemix.net/devops/getting-started).~otc-ui572
  The toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.
  If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Deploy**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and
  terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).~otc-ui573
  Still need to create a project at JazzHub? You can still
  [create a project](https://hub.jazz.net/deploy?legacy&repository={[{repository}]}),~otc-ui574
  but if you do, you must upgrade that project to a toolchain soon.

  deployed, you can see it running by clicking **View app**.
