template.description: 2:|
  After you click **Deploy**, your app will be deployed to Bluemix.
  Your app's code will be automatically loaded into a Git repo. Each time you commit
  changes to the repo, they are automatically deployed by using a toolchain that is
  associated with your app. You can add more tools to the toolchain and share it with
  your team. [Learn more](https:3://bluemix.net/devops/getting-started).
  The toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.
  If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Deploy**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and
  terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https:4://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).
  Still need to create a project at JazzHub? You can still
  [create a project](https:5://hub.jazz.net/deploy?legacy&repository={[{repository}]}),
  but if you do, you must upgrade that project to a toolchain soon.
toolchain.getting_started: 6:>-
  **Your toolchain is ready! Quick start:7:** This toolchain was created for your app.
  To watch the pipeline deploy your app, click **Delivery Pipeline**. After the app is
  deployed, you can see it running by clicking **View app**.
