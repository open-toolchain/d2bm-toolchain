template.name: "Deploy to Bluemix toolchain"
template.description: |
  This toolchain contains tools to develop and deploy your app. After you click **Create**,
  your toolchain is shown, and you can click  **Delivery Pipeline** to watch your app as
  it is deployed. When the pipeline is finished, click **View app** to see the running app.

  This toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.
  If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click
  **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and
  terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).

  Still need to create a project at JazzHub? You can still
  [create a project](https://hub.jazz.net/deploy?repository={{repository}}),
  but if you do, you must upgrade that project to a toolchain soon.

  This is the toolchain for your application. You can watch the pipeline deploy it
