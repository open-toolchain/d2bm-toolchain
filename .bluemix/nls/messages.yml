  Your app will be enabled for Continuous Delivery by using this toolchain. The toolchain
  includes a clone of your Git repo with issue tracking, a pipeline for building and
  deploying code changes, and a Web IDE for editing code on the cloud. After you create
  the toolchain, you can configure it and add more tools to it.
